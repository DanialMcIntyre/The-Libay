Here's a small description of the project:
This website allows users to search Google's Book API for books and see their details. 
Users can also create 'bookshelves' in their library, which can store books they search for, 
allowing them to easily organize their books. There is a fully functioning authentication system 
with an admin that can see all users. Start by clicking the buttons in the navbar after logging in.
